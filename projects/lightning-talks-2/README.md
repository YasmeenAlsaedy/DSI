### Lightning Talks 2

Lightning Talks 2 are an opportunity for you to learn and present a topic we have not yet covered in class. Each Lightning talk should be around 10 minutes long and you will present the topic to whole class with the assumption that they are entirely new to the subject - just like you once were. You will be randomly assigned a topic as the data approaches. If your topic is more code oriented, feel free to do a code along - if your topic is more theory, please create a slide deck. You can view an example Lightning Talk for NLP [HERE](./example)
