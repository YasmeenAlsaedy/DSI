### Lightning Talks I

Lightning Talks are an opportunity to review and present what you have learned over the course thus far. Each Lightning talk should be around 6-8 minutes long and you will present the topic to whole class with the assumption that they are entirely new to the subject - just like you once were. You will be randomly assigned a topic as the data approaches. If your topic is more code oriented, feel free to do a code along - if your topic is more theory, please create a slide deck. You can view an example Lightning Talk for NLP [HERE](./example)
