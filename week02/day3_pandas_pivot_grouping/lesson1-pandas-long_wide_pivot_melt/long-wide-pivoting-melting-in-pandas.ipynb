    "## `pandas` Long Format, Wide Format, Pivot Tables, and Melting\n",
    "_Instructor: Aymeric Flaisler_\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is all about **transforming data** using `pandas`. Data transformation is the reorganization of your data set's rows and columns into a different, potentially **more useful shape and format**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of transforming your data include **better access to relevant information** and **streamlined data manipulation**. As you become more familiar with data sets and their associated operations, you will develop an intuition and appreciation for when it's better to **work row-wise or column-wise**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different data formats are better for different tasks. It takes time and experience to learn the distinctions. But, for now, we'll introduce the **common structures, transformations, and how to apply these transformations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the differences between **long and wide format data**.\n",
    "- Understand **pivot tables**.\n",
    "- Practice transforming data between **long and wide** formats.\n",
    "- Practice creating pivot tables.\n",
    "- Learn how to avoid **common pitfalls and obstacles** in data transformation with `pandas`.\n"

    "Between \"wide\" and \"long,\" **wide format data is the more intuitive**. It's also a common format for `.csv` files. You've already viewed multiple data sets in wide format throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide format data is structured so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique IDs, subjects, observations, etc. are represented as **rows**.\n",
    "- Distinct information categories (**variables**) are represented as columns. In other words, there is a **column for every \"variable\"** with its own unique values.\n",
    "- This format can often be a more compact matrix, particularly if little or no information is missing.\n",
    "- It is **not as useful for SQL-style operations**: It can make it much harder or even impossible to **join tables together on a value**.\n",
    "- It can be useful in `pandas` when you need to perform operations on variables **across columns**; for example, multiplying columns together to create a new column.\n",
    "- It is the data format required for statistical modeling (with few exceptions)."

    "- **`values`**: A single column indicating the values to use when pivoting and filling the new wide format columns.\n",
    "- **`index`**: Columns in the long format data that are index variables. These will be left as single columns, not spread out by unique value like in the `columns` parameter.\n",
    "- **`aggfunc`**: Often `.pivot_table()` is used to perform a summary of the data. `aggfunc` stands for \"aggregation function.\" It's required and defaults to `np.mean()`. You can also insert your own function, which we'll demonstrate below.\n",
    "- **`fill_value`**: If a cell is missing for the wide format data, this value will fill it in.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Next we'll put in our own function — `select_item_or_nan()` — to the `aggfunc` keyword argument. Because my `subject_id` column has a single variable value for each ID, I just want the single element in the long format value cell. My data is messy, so I have to write a function to check for places it could break. \n",
